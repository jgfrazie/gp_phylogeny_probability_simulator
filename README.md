# gp_phylogeny_probability_simulator

Simulates an arbitrary Genetic Programming run and provides some statistical insight as to how likely any case for an individual is inherited from an ancestor.

## How to Use

Simulate a run with specified parameters found in the main function. Then, specify your target generation and ancestor boundaries. Run the file and the results will print out in this order:

1) Experimental Results
2) Estimated Threshold Results

## TODO (eventually)

1) Put simulator in class
2) Possibly put statistics stuff in class as well?
3) Clean up documentation
